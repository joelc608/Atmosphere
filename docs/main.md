# Atmosphère Docs

Atmosphère is a work-in-progress customized firmware for the Nintendo Switch. Atmosphere consists of several different components, each in charge of performing different system functions of the Nintendo Switch.

The components of Atmosphère are:
+ [Fusée](../docs/components/fusee.md), a custom bootloader.
+ [Exosphère](../docs/components/exosphere.md), a fully-featured custom secure monitor.
+ [Stratosphère](../docs/components/stratosphere.md), a set of custom system modules
+ [Troposphère](../docs/components/troposphere.md), Application-level patches to the Horizon OS. This has not been implemented yet.
+ [Thermosphère](../docs/components/thermosphere.md), a hypervisor-based emunand implementation.

A guide to building Atmosphère can be found [here](../docs/building.md).
